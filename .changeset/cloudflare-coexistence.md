Coexist with `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` (Start-on-Cloudflare apps like tanstack.com): its workerd dev proxy owns the dev port's WebSocket upgrades and drops genie's socket within milliseconds (close 1006, permanent reconnect flap). The `genie()` plugin now detects the Cloudflare plugin in the resolved config and reroutes transport automatically — it starts a standalone hub on its own port, points the injected client's WebSocket at it, writes discovery for the CLI accordingly, and shuts the hub down with the dev server (a killed server heals via the existing stale-pid cleanup). No wiring changes: `genie()` + `<Genie />` stay as-is, and existing setups fix themselves on upgrade. `init` prints a note when it sees the Cloudflare plugin in dependencies.
